# Chord Generator

The **Chord Generator** is a transformer model trained from scratch on musical chord sequences.

## Inspiration

Having played around with piano composition, I embarked on a project to train a transformer model to help me produce chord sequences. This endeavor has been both enjoyable and beneficial in enhancing my musical creativity.

## How It Works

- **Model Architecture**: The `structure` folder contains the architecture of the model, along with useful files, such as the Tokenizer and Dataset classes.
- **Global Variables**: Global variables and parameters are defined in the `utils` file.
- **Training the Model**: To train the model, run the training script located at `run/train.py`.
- **Running Inference**: To run inference on the saved model, execute the script found at `run/inference.py`.

## Current Status

The project is still ongoing, which means the best results are not yet finalized. However, the code is operational, and you're welcome to give it a try!
